#  Linear Regression from Scratch in Machine Learning

Developed a linear regression model from scratch, encompassing data generation, weight estimation, and prediction functions, and acquired valuable knowledge in regression, optimization, and statistical analysis
Employed gradient descent optimization for weight estimation, considering L2 regularization \
Gained insights into the relationships between training and validation NRMSE with different factors



#  Down-Syndrome-Prediction-from-Mice-Protein-Expression-Levels
 Binary and Quaternary Classification for Down Syndrome Prediction from Mice Protein Expression Levels

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, eliminated the correlated variables and imputed missing variables
Trained and tuned hyperparameters for Linear & RBF kernel SVM, Neural Network & Random Forest models
Utilized RFECV analysis to identify crucial proteins and eliminate variables to achieve 97% accuracy

# Clustering And Dimensionality Reduction On Image Data Set 
Loaded, visualized, and centered Fashion-MNIST dataset for improved data interpretation and processing
◦ Reduced image size using PCAtechnique & visualized the impact comparing original versus reconstructed image ◦ Performed cluster analysis using K-means on reduced data set to group similar type of data in single group
